# Rhythmic Squad's Grace Shopper

Welcome to our eCommerce site: A Space Apart.

## Set-Up

Before starting up for the first time, please run:
```
npm install
createdb grace_shopper
npm run seed
```

You can then run in a development environment with the `build:dev` and `start:dev` scripts. These will run webpack and nodemon, respectively, with watch flags to catch any changes. You can also run `test:dev` to run tests with the watch flag.
